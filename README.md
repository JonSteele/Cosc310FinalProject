Cosc310FinalProject
===================

Final Project for COSC 310

-There is no web interface, or requirements for the program to run.

Summary:

SportsTriviaBot is designed to test your knowledge of your favourite sports teams. 
He will ask you for your favourite sport and team and then ask you questions about that team.
If you get the question wrong, he will let you try again and if you get the question correct
you can move onto a different question by typing in a team name or typing "change" to switch sports.
There are no A+ features implemented in this program.

Files:

SportsTriviaBot.jar - Executable jar file this is the entire program
to run it use the command java -jar SportsTriviaBot.jar

Issues:

-Bot only knows very limited amount of trivia questions, I would add more in the future to make it more fun to talk to
-Does not account for typo's and shortcuts, I would include a way around this in the future.
-Would like to include a nice interface in the future to make it easier to speak to
